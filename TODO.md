# December 23 - 26

- [x] FIX AI's Side for Updating Middle Card (used + instead of - for x shift for AI)
- [ ] Place images on super pixels and calculate size ranges.
- [ ] Add autoclicking modules to requirements.txt
- [ ] Add a lint that is applied before git commits.
- [ ] Add a lot of comments and cleanup to update_card() so that it's clear what code is doing.
- [ ] Bug with selecting 6s or 7s (in base game example), since a 6 might not be available for set of cards with no relationship.

- [ ] Insert a penalty if the model gets the guess wrong.
- [ ] Clean up np.where code and weird indexing. It makes it hard to read.
